## Running unit tests

Tests are set up to run with Chromium, you will need to export your Chrome bin path to CHROME_BIN var.

If you have Chrome installed at its default location you don't need to export this var.

If you wish to use another web browser to run tests you will have to insall another launcher from https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:karma-launcher and change the 'browsers' value in karma.conf.js
